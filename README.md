# react-boilerplate

I made this boilerplate template to solve a problem I had. I was tired of spending a bunch of time doing basic configuration
everytime I started a new React project. So I made this barebones template that I clone everytime I start a new project and it
saves me a lot of time.

## This template includes:
* Basic file structure
* Basic Webpack Config
* Basic Express server
* Starter component

## How To Use This Template
1. Fork this repo
2. Clone the repo to your local machine
3. Rename the project folder
4. If there is a .git folder in the project directory delete it
5. On Github create a new repo
6. commit and push the project to the new repo you created
